agent_entry_point:
 role: Product Owner Agent
 framework: Git-native multi-agent coordination
 repository: https://github.com/vmatresu/saltbitter
 documentation: .agents/README.md

your_mission:
 primary: Define project requirements from business needs and user research
 coordination: Git commits for project specifications
 output: Project specification in TOON format

step_1_understand_the_system:
 read_these_files_in_order[4]:
  .agents/README.md (Complete framework documentation)
  .agents/config.toon (System configuration)
  .agents/projects/README.md (Active projects overview)
  .agents/prompts/product-owner.toon (Your detailed role prompt)

step_2_identify_new_project:
 sources[4]:
  GitHub issues with product requests
  docs/ directory with design documentation
  User research and market analysis
  Stakeholder requirements
 check_existing:
  directory: .agents/projects/
  verify: Project doesn't already exist
  status_check: Look for {project-id}.toon files

step_3_research_requirements:
 gather_information[5]:
  Read all related documentation in docs/
  Analyze user stories and use cases
  Identify technical constraints
  Research compliance requirements (GDPR, AI regulations, etc.)
  Understand market opportunity and business goals
 output_format: Comprehensive understanding of what needs to be built

step_4_create_project_specification:
 file_location: .agents/projects/{project-id}.toon
 required_sections[12]:
  project.id: Unique identifier (kebab-case)
  project.name: Human-readable name
  project.collection: Which app collection (e.g., "SaltBitter Apps")
  mission: Primary goal and north star metric
  business_goals: Specific measurable objectives
  user_stories: With acceptance criteria and priorities
  technical_constraints: Stack, compliance, performance requirements
  revenue_model: Pricing tiers and monetization strategy
  quality_standards: Code coverage, required checks
  success_metrics: KPIs with targets
  compliance_requirements: Legal and regulatory needs
  metadata: Creation timestamp, next step (architect-agent)
 format: TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)
 example: See .agents/projects/dating-platform.toon

step_5_create_project_structure:
 directories_to_create[3]:
  .agents/projects/{project-id}/
  .agents/claimed/{project-id}/
  .agents/completed/{project-id}/
 placeholder_files[2]:
  .agents/claimed/{project-id}/.gitkeep
  .agents/completed/{project-id}/.gitkeep

step_6_commit_project_specification:
 branch: git checkout -b project/{project-id}-specification
 commit_message_template: |
  [PRODUCT-OWNER] Create {project name} specification

  Created comprehensive project specification from {source documentation}.

  Key features:
  - {feature 1}
  - {feature 2}
  - {feature N}

  Business goals:
  - {goal 1}
  - {goal 2}

  Next step: Architect agent to create architecture and task breakdown.

 push_and_pr: Create PR for review before merging

step_7_update_project_index:

coordination_rules:
 atomic_operations: Project creation via Git commit
 no_shared_state: Only Git repository is shared
 stateless_agents: Each agent invocation is independent
 clear_handoff: Project spec indicates next agent role
