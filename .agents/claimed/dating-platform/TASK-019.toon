 title: Create comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline
 type: infrastructure
 priority: 8
 status: claimed

description:
 summary: Build complete testing infrastructure and GitHub Actions CI/CD
 details: |
  Implement testing and deployment:
  - Unit tests with pytest (85%+ coverage)
  - Integration tests for all services
  - E2E tests with Playwright
  - Security scanning (bandit, npm audit)
  - Type checking (mypy strict mode)
  - Linting (ruff for Python, ESLint for TypeScript)
  - Performance benchmarking
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automated deployment to dev/staging/prod
  - Rollback procedures

 Bandit security scans passing
 npm audit shows no vulnerabilities
 mypy type checking in strict mode
 ruff and ESLint passing with no warnings
 Performance benchmarks meet targets
 GitHub Actions run on all PRs
 Automated deployment to staging on merge
 Manual approval required for production
 Rollback script tested and documented
