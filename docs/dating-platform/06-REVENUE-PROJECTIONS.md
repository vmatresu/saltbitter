## Break-Even Analysis

### When Does SaltBitter Become Profitable?

**Assumptions**:
- Fixed costs stabilize at $200k/month
- Variable costs remain ~45% of revenue
- Growth continues at 15% MoM (conservative from Month 12)

**Break-Even Calculation**:
```
Revenue = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost % × Revenue)
Revenue × (1 - 0.45) = $200,000
Revenue × 0.55 = $200,000
Revenue = $363,636/month

At 10.5% conversion and $15/user ARPU:
Users needed = $363,636 / $1.58 (ARPU per total user)
= ~230,000 total active users
```

**Projected Break-Even**: Month 16 (Q2 Year 2)
