framework:
 name: Agents-Core
 tagline: Portable Git-Native Multi-Agent Coordination Framework
 version: 1.0.0
 release_date: 2025-11-19

description: |
  A drop-in framework for enabling multi-agent teams to coordinate
  via Git + TOON format. Agents (LLMs) work autonomously on tasks,
  coordinating through atomic Git operations with zero central database.

key_features[8]:
 Portable: Copy .agents-core/ to any repo to enable multi-agent coordination
 Git-native: All coordination through Git commits (atomic, first-commit-wins)
 TOON format: 40% fewer tokens vs JSON for agent context
 Role-based: Product Owner → Architect → Engineers → Reviewers
 Stateless agents: Each invocation independent, full context from Git
 Parallel execution: Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks
 Dependency management: Automatic task unlocking when dependencies complete
 Zero infrastructure: No database, no servers, just Git

components:
 core: Framework logic (protocols, templates, roles) - DO NOT EDIT
 config: Project-specific settings (tech stack, quality standards) - USER EDITS
 scripts: Atomic helpers for claim/complete/heartbeat operations
 start: Entry points for invoking different agent roles
 state: Dynamic task state (tasks/, claimed/, completed/) - GIT TRACKED

 git_version: 2.0+
