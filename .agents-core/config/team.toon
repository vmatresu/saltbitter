agent_configuration:
 default_model: claude-sonnet-4
 max_concurrent_agents: 4
 agent_id_format: "{role}-{timestamp}-{random}"

 retry_policy:
  max_retries: 4
  backoff_strategy: exponential
  backoff_base_seconds: 2

orchestration:
 enabled: true
 poll_interval_minutes: 10
 max_tasks_per_cycle: 3

communication:
 method: Git commits (asynchronous)
 no_direct_messaging: true
 coordination_primitives[3]:
  Task files (work to be done)
  Commit messages (signals)
  File locations (state transitions)

role_permissions:
 product_owner[3]:
  write: config/project.toon
  read: all
  git_branch: develop

 architect[4]:
  write: state/{project}/architecture.toon, state/{project}/tasks/
  read: config/*, state/{project}/
  git_branch: develop
  creates: Project directory structure

 engineer[4]:
  write: code files, state/{project}/claimed/, state/{project}/completed/
  read: config/*, state/{project}/
  git_branches: develop (claim/complete), feature/* (implementation)
  moves_files: tasks/ → claimed/ → completed/

 reviewer[3]:
  write: PR reviews
  read: code files, state/{project}/completed/, PRs
  git_branch: none (reviews only)

team_workflows:
 project_inception:
  roles[1]: product_owner
  output: config/project.toon
  next: architect

 architecture_phase:
  roles[1]: architect
  input: config/project.toon
  output: architecture + tasks
  next: engineers

 implementation_phase:
  roles[2]: engineer (multiple in parallel)
  input: available tasks
  output: code + tests + PRs
  next: reviewer (per PR)

 review_phase:
  roles[1]: reviewer
  input: pull request
  output: approval or change requests
  next: merge or engineer (if changes)

collaboration_patterns:
 parallel_execution:
  who: Multiple engineers
  what: Independent tasks
  coordination: Git atomic operations

 sequential_dependencies:
  what: Task A depends on Task B
  enforcement: task.dependencies.required
  automatic: B completion unlocks A

 feedback_loops:
  reviewer_to_engineer: Via PR comments
  architect_to_po: Via discussions (outside Git)
  engineer_to_architect: Via questions (outside Git)

agent_autonomy:
 decision_making:
  engineers: Full autonomy on implementation details
  architects: Full autonomy on architecture design
  reviewers: Full autonomy on code quality decisions
  product_owners: Full autonomy on requirements

 constraints:
  must_follow: config/quality-standards.toon
  must_use: config/tech-stack.toon
  must_respect: task.acceptance_criteria

escalation:
 when_needed[4]:
  Unclear requirements (engineer → product owner)
  Architectural concerns (engineer → architect)
  Security vulnerabilities (reviewer → architect)
  Blocked tasks (any → human)

 mechanism: Outside Git (Slack, email, GitHub issues)

performance_metrics:
 track_per_agent[5]:
  tasks_claimed: Count
  tasks_completed: Count
  average_completion_time: Hours
  pr_approval_rate: Percentage
  bugs_introduced: Count

 track_per_project[4]:
  total_tasks: Count
  completed_tasks: Count
  average_task_duration: Hours
  code_coverage: Percentage

team_expansion:
 add_new_role:
  step_1: Create core/roles/{new-role}.toon
  step_2: Create start/{new-role}.toon
  step_3: Update config/team.toon
  step_4: Document in BOOTSTRAP.md

 example_new_roles[4]:
  security_auditor (security reviews)
  ux_designer (design tasks)
  data_engineer (data pipeline tasks)
  devops_engineer (infrastructure tasks)

best_practices:
 clear_responsibilities: Each role has distinct purpose
 no_overlap: Avoid role confusion
 autonomous_agents: Agents make decisions independently
 git_coordination: All coordination through Git
 quality_first: Never compromise on quality standards
